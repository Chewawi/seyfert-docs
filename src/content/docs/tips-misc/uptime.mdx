title: Adding Uptime to the Client

## Tracking Uptime in Your Seyfert Bot

Adding an `uptime` property to your bot’s client is a simple way to track when your bot started running. This guide will show you how to extend the Seyfert client, initialize the `uptime` property, and use it with a timestamp formatter for displaying the bot's uptime.

### Adding `uptime` to the Client

To begin, extend the `UsingClient` interface by adding the `uptime` property. This ensures that the property is type-checked across your project.

#### Step 1: Extend the Interface

Update your [Declare Module](https://docs.seyfert.dev/getting-started/declare-module) file with the following code:

```ts
declare module "seyfert" {
  interface UsingClient extends ParseClient<Client<true>> {
    // Other custom properties...
    uptime: Date; // Tracks when the bot started
  }

  // Other declarations...
}
```

### Initializing `uptime`

The `uptime` property should be set when the bot is ready. This can be done in the `ready` event handler.

#### Step 2: Set `uptime` in the Ready Event

Add the following code to your `ready` event handler:

```ts
import { createEvent } from "seyfert";

export default createEvent({
  data: { once: true, name: "botReady" },
  run(user, client) {
    // Set the uptime to the current date and time
    client.uptime = new Date();

    // Other startup logic...
  },
});
```

This ensures that `client.uptime` is initialized to the exact moment the bot becomes ready.

### Using the `uptime` Property

You can display the `uptime` using a timestamp formatter. This is especially useful for commands or logs.

#### Step 3: Format `uptime` as a Timestamp

To format and display the `uptime` value, use the `Formatter.timestamp` method:

```ts
Formatter.timestamp(client.uptime);
```

This will return a formatted timestamp that you can include in your messages or logs.

### Example Command

Here’s an example command to display the bot’s uptime:

```ts
import { Command, Formatter } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
    name: 'uptime',
    description: 'Show the bot’s uptime',
})
export default class UptimeCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx) {
        const uptimeFormatted = Formatter.timestamp(ctx.client.uptime);
        await ctx.editOrReply({ content: `The bot has been running since ${uptimeFormatted}.` });
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

By extending your client with an `uptime` property, you gain the ability to track and display your bot's runtime in a user-friendly way. This feature not only improves monitoring but also enhances the overall user experience.
