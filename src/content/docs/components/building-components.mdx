title: Building components

import { TabItem, Tabs } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Components are built with a builder, which is a JavaScript class, which represents it. Within this builder you can customize the component such it's text or it's color.

There are diffrent types of components' builders with diffrent customization but all have a common property: the custom Id. A unique identifier which is used for handling the interactions of the component.

## ActionRow

All the builders are sent within an [`ActionRow`](/api/classes/actionrow). Each message can contain a maxium of 5 actions row.

Here is how we create a basic ActionRow:

```ts {"Set all the components within this ActionRow": 4-5} {"Add components to the ActionRow": 6-7} showLineNumbers copy

import { ActionRow } from 'seyfert';

const row = new ActionRow()

.setComponents()

.addComponents()

```

## Building each type of component

Now we are going to build each type of component and set it within an ActionRow:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="button.ts">

An ActionRow shouldn't contain more than 5 buttons.

```ts showLineNumbers copy

import {
    ActionRow,
    Button
} from 'seyfert';

const button = new Button()
.setCustomId('first-button')
.setLabel('First Button')

const row = new ActionRow()
.setComponents(button)

```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
