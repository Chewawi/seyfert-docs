## Updating seyfert config

Before starting this chapter we shall update `seyfert.config.js` in order to tell seyfert where our commands file will be.

```ts {10} title="seyfert.config.js" showLineNumbers
// @ts-check
const { config } = require('seyfert');

module.exports = config.bot({
  token: process.env.BOT_TOKEN ?? "",
  intents: ["Guilds"],
  locations: {
    base: "src",
    output: "dist",
    commands: "commands" // - src/commands will be our commands directory
  }
});
```

## Declaring commands

Each command file needs to export by default the command class so seyfert is able to load it.

For this example we'll setup `ping` command, let's start by declaring the ping command class as shown below.

```ts title="src/commands/ping.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Declare, Command, type CommandContext } from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Show the ping with discord'
})
export default class PingCommand extends Command {

	async run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// average latency between shards
    const ping = ctx.client.gateway.latency;

    await ctx.write({
      content: `The ping is \`${ping}\``
    });
  }
}
```

To test whether your command works, you must publish it on Discord before making minor changes to your main file:

```ts {5-5} title="src/index.ts" showLineNumbers
import { Client, ParseClient } from "seyfert";

const client = new Client();

client.start().then(() => client.uploadCommands());

// here goes the declare module made in the previous step
```

Pretty simple, isn't it? But sometimes commands are not just about receiving a request and responding it, you also have to think about what the user wants, that's where the `options` come in, let's add an option to hide the response.

## Using options

```ts {4-5,10-14,20,23-24} title="src/commands/ping.ts" showLineNumbers
import {
  Command,
  Declare,
  Options,
  createBooleanOption,
  type CommandContext
} from 'seyfert';
import { MessageFlags } from 'seyfert/lib/types';

const options = {
  hide: createBooleanOption({
    description: "Hide command output",
  }),
}

@Declare({
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Show the ping with discord'
})
@Options(options)
export default class PingCommand extends Command {

  async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>) {
    const flags = ctx.options.hide ? MessageFlags.Ephemeral : undefined;

    // average latency between shards
    const ping = ctx.client.gateway.latency;

    await ctx.write({
      content: `The ping is \`${ping}\``,
      flags,
    });
  }

}
```

Below is how the file tree should look like after adding the command.

<FileTree>
- src
	- commands
		- **ping.ts** 
	- index.ts
- package.json
- seyfert.config.js
- .env
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>
